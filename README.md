# Basics of software/hardware interviews

An attempt to solve common interview questions. Some of solutions are my own, while others have been taken from various books, and online sources which I have tried to document below.

Different implementations for a particular question are also included in the same file

Compile a file (E.g. test.cpp) with either of the following:
- ```g++ -std=c++0x test.cpp && ./a.out```
- ```g++ -std=c++11 test.cpp && ./a.out```

To compile a program with thread support use:
```g++ -std=c++11 -pthread basic_threads.cpp && ./a.out```

References I commonly refer for solutions, and hints:
- Cracking the coding interview (6th edition)
- http://geeksforgeeks.org/
- Stack overflow
- Wikipedia for theory

Futher questions, solutions will come from:
- Programming Pearls (Problem solving)
- Introduction to Information Retrieval (System design)
- Introduction to Algorithms (3rd edition)
