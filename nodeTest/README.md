## Basics JS
 - functions are called methods


### Data types
 - complex data type (mutable)
   - Object data type
     - Unordered list of data types (primitive or reference) stored at name-value pairs
     - Each item in the list is called a property
     - E.g.
     ```
     var myFirstObject = {
        firstName: "abcd",
        lastName: "efgh"
     };
     ```
 - primitive/simple data types (immutable)
   - Number
   - String
   - Boolean
   - Undefined
   - Null
