## Compression and color palettes:
  #### There are 2 types of compression:
    - Lossless: The image is made smaller, but at no detriment to the quality
    - Lossy: The image is made smaller, but at a detriment to the quality. If you saved an image in a Lossy format over and over, the image quality would get progressively worse and worse

  #### There are 2 types of color depths (palettes):
    - Indexed color: Indexed means that the image can only store a limited number of colours (usually 256), controlled by the author, in something called a Color Map
    - Direct color: Direct means that you can store many thousands of colours that have not been directly chosen by the author

  #### Image formats and their uses:
    - BMP    : Lossless / Indexed and Direct
    - GIF    : Lossless / Indexed only
      - Good for: Logos, line drawings, and other simple images that need to be small. Only really used for websites
    - JPEG   : Lossy / Direct
      - Good for: Photographs
    - SVG    : Lossless / Vector
      - Scalable Vector Graphics
      - defines vector-based graphics in XML format
