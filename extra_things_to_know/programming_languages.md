### Pros and cons of using Ruby
  - Pros
    - Tooling:
      - Rails provides fantastic tooling that helps you to deliver more features in less time
      - It provides a standard structure for web apps, where all the common patterns are taken care of for you
    - Libraries:
      - There's a gem for just about anything you can think of. They are all publicly available and searchable
    - Test Automation and Large community:
      - very popular language and lots of support online
      - The Ruby community is big in to testing and test automation
  - Cons
    - Active records (have had problems in updating records cos a previous one is stored)
    - converts anything to a string if concat + with a string
    - types (have tried to write in functional lang)
    - functions can have extra arguments and not all need to be passed

### Pros and cons of using Javascript
  - Pros
    - Speed, Simplicity
    - Popular
    - lot of support and libraries
  - Cons
    - functions can have extra arguments and not all need to be passed
    - Variables get loose and go off to the global scope when forgetting "var"
    - Async call stacks are hard to debug (currently facing this problem, seems like a timing issue)
    - types
    - runtime exceptions
    - Even Though JavaScript is supposed to be cross platform, some features are browser dependent (caniuser website to check)
    - There are many properties/methods in JavaScript which are implemented differently across browsers
