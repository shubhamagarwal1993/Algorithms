// Steps for finding MST using Kruskal's algorithm
//
// Sort all the edges in incresing order of their weight
// Pick the smallest edge. Check if it forms a cycle with the spanning tree formed so far.
//   If cycle is not formed, include this edge. Else discard it
// Repeat above step till there are (V - 1) edges in the spanning tree
