### Important properties of a service oriented architecture:
 - Concurrency: parallel processing and algos, starvation, consistency
 - Networking: TCP/IP, throughput, latency
 - Abstraction: OS, filesystem, and database. Various levels of caching
 - Real-world performance: speed of everything your computer can do - RAM, SSD, network speed
 - Estimation: back of the envelope estimation for memory needed, etc
 - Availability and reliability: how things can fail in a distributed environment

### Design properties:
 - Redundancy
 - Load balancing
 - Efficiency
 - Isolation

### Major Components:
 - Client
   - DNS lookup, HTTP request
 - Load balancer
 - Web servers
 - Load balancer
 - Database
