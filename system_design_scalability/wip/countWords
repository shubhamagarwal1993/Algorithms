// Given millions of documents, find all documents that contain a list of complete words
    - assumption - findWords() function will be called repetedly, thus we can pre-process

Step 1: Solving this with few dozen documents
    - create hash table with key as word and value as list of documents that contain the word
    - for multiple words, take intersection of values of those words

problem: with many documents, one hash table cannot contain all the data on one machine

Step 2: concerns of divind up the hash table
    - divide it by keyword, or divide by documents.
    - a lookup table to know which machine holds which data
    ... a lot of other concerns

Step 3: We can also think of a different structure like a trie
