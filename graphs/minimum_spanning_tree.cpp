// Spanning Tree - Given a connected and undirected graph, a spanning tree of that graph is a subgraph that is a tree and connects all the vertices together. A single graph can have many different spanning trees
// Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) or minimum weight spanning tree - For a weighted, connected and undirected graph is a spanning tree with weight less than or equal to the weight of every other spanning tree. The weight of a spanning tree is the sum of weights given to each edge of the spanning tree
// A minimum spanning tree has (V â€“ 1) edges where V is the number of vertices in the given graph
