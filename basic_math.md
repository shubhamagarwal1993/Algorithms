## Common Summation Formulas
    ### Sum of int 1 to N
     - (1 + 2 + ...... + N) = `n(n+1)/2`

    - Sum of powers of 2 (2^0 +2^1 + ..... + 2^n) = `(2^(n+1))-1`
    - The sum of a sequence of powers of two is rougly equal to the next value in the sequence

    - Permutations of n unique characters
	n! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ....... * 1

Forming a k length string (with all unique characters) from n total unique characters
	n!/(n-k)! = n * (n-1) * (n-2) * ....... * (n-k+1)

How many k sized subsets are there out of n distinct elements? (order does not matter)
	(n k) = n!/(k! * (n-k)!)

Big O     : upper bound on time, less than equal to relationship
Big theta : upper and lower bound on time
Big omega : lower bound on time, greater than equal to relationship

Some Big O runtimes - O(log N), O(N logN), O(N), O(N^2), O(2^N)

Data Structures run times:
	Lists					
	Vectors / Arraylists
	Heaps
	Trees
	Tries
	Graphs
	Hash table
