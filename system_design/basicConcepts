// System Design and Scalibility

Steps:
    think broad
    white board a diagram to show general layout
    make careful assumptions - ask questions to make better assumptions - estimate when possible
    identify key issues like bottle necks, memory management, caching (redis is in-memory)
    point out practical solutions like spitting up databases, webservers - loadbalancers
    scaling - how do to horizontal scaling - like loadbalancers and multiple servers
    database can be slow - talk about indexing, mySql is almost always good way to go - inner join and no left join

Concepts to know:
 - map reduce: calculating avg temperatures, counting word count in a file. Any data that can be split up
 - AVL trees: 
 - red black trees:
