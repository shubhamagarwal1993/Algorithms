1. Logical timestamps:
   Event c = 4
   Event f = 6

2. Events concurrent with e = a, b, h

3. Events happened-before event c = a, b, h, e, g

4. (a) False
4. (b) True

5. Yes
 
   Explanation: 

Some given facts:
	-	Nodes use a reliable broadcast channel. Thus, we will not have any conditions in which packets drop or have to be resent, or anything else.
	-	Each transmitted message is received by all the nodes. Thus, we will also not have the condition of a node sending messages to some of the 
		nodes and then failing preventing the other nodes from getting the broadcast.

	Let us assume that the nodes have an initial value. By the consensus problem, we agree that all the nodes will choose the value that is supported 
	by the maximum number of nodes.

	Round 1: {p1 = 0}, {p2 = 1}, {p3 = 0}, {p4 = 1}
	Now, all the nodes broadcast a message to all the other nodes containing the value they have. Let us assume that node p4 crashes before broadcasting.
	
	The following values will be recorded in the nodes .
	Round 2: {p1 = 0, p2 = 1, p3 = 0}, {p2 = 1, p1 = 0, p3 = 0}, {p3 = 0, p1 = 0, p2 = 1}, {p4 = crashed}

	So, we see here that the first three nodes all have some values and the fourth one does not matter. Based on the values in individual nodes, 
	we see that all the nodes decide on the value 0 as it occurs the maximum number of times.
