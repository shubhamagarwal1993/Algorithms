Homework 4 Answer Sheet


1. No. A counter example is as follows. A diagram of the same has been included in a pdf on 	
	subversion.
	Eg.
	Let there be 4 events M1, M2, M3, M4 and 2 processes P1, and P2.
	Now M1->M4, M1->M2, M2->M3
	Let M1 and M4 be broadcast messages from P1
	Let M2 and M3 be broadcast messages from P2
	Thus, on drawing the diagram, we see that we can get one case where P1 will get messages in the order M2, M1, M3, M4.
	We have achieved FIFO and total-ordering here but not causal ordering. 

2. No. A counter example is as follows. A diagram of the same has been included in a pdf on 
	subversion.
	Eg. This example has been taken from the lecture slides. Here, on looking at the three 	
	orderings, we see that:

	Causal oredering implies FIFO ordering.
	Causal ordering does not imply total ordering as we can see that the order in which the packets are received by causal
	and total ordering are not the same. 
	Thus, causal and FIFO ordering together do not imply Causal ordering. 


3. (a)
		X[1] = [(1/3) (2/3)] [X]
		Y[1] = [(2/3) (1/3)] [Y]

		X[1] = (X/3) + (2Y/3)
	    -----------------------------
	    |	Y[1] = (2X/3) + (Y/3)	|
	    -----------------------------

		Since; X = 1 and Y = 2

		X[1] = (1/3) + (4/3)
		Y[1] = (2/3) + (2/3)

		X[1] = [5/3]
	    ---------------------
	    |	Y[1] = [4/3]	|
	    ---------------------
		
3. (b) No, average consensus is not achievable by the resulting algorithm as the graph is not 
		strongly connected. 
		i.e. paths between all pairs of nodes is present.
	   	This is because the elements in rows and columns do not add up to 1.
	   	A diagram of the same has been drawn in the pdf on subversion.	

4. f -> (2, 4, 2)
   g -> (0, 2, 1)
 
5. (a) True
	If it had been V(x) <= V(y), then it would be false.
5. (b) True
	Since the time stamps have two different values, they are concurrent.
