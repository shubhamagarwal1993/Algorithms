Homework 6 - Answer Sheet

  1.	NO
	referred here: (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paxos_%28computer_science%29)
	It states that "no deterministic fault-tolerant consensus protocol can guarantee progress in an asynchronous network (a result proved in a paper by 
	Fischer, Lynch and Paterson), Paxos guarantees safety (consistency), and the conditions that could prevent it from making progress are difficult to 
	provoke".

  2.(a) Picture is in the pdf
  	(b) successor.key(8)   = 8
  		successor.key(120) = 2
  		  
  3.	YES
  	The paper here (http://www.cs.indiana.edu/ftp/techreports/TR481.pdf ) says that we can implement the bully algorithm for an asynchronous system.

  4.(a) NO     ->The reason is in the pdf file
  (b) YES	 ->The reason is in the pdf file

  5.(a) YES    ->The reason is in the pdf file
